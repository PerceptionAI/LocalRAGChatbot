This is a work in progress for completely local, talking chatbot where you can ask question upon providing .txt files that contain the topics for discussion.  You need an NVidia GPU to run this so it will not work on a Mac. 
You will need to upload the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF model from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2.2.1-mistral-7B-GGUF.  You also need to provide around 15 seconds or more of a sample voice
